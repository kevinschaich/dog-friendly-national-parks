Pets are not allowed in public buildings, public transportation vehicles, swimming beaches, and structures. Pets, including cats, dogs or other domesticated animals are not allowed on hiking trails or within park buildings. Pets, especially dogs, pose a safety threat to hikers and other park visitors as well as to park resources.

Arches
==========

Pets are welcome at Arches National Park, but activities with pets are limited. Pets must be leashed at all times. Please clean up after your pet. Pets may not be left unattended (except in a paid-for campsite in Devils Garden Campground, where they must not cause a disturbance).
You may have your pet with you:

on all park roads
in parking areas
in picnic areas
in Devils Garden Campground

You may not have your pet with you:

at any overlooks
on any hiking trails, or anywhere off-trails
in the visitor center

Important!
The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car when temperatures are above 68 degrees, even with the windows cracked.
Pet Boarding
It may be easier to explore the park if you leave your pet at home or board it at a nearby kennel. Moab has kennels with boarding service.
Other Local Services
Visit discovermoab.com for a listing of nearby kennels, veterinarians, and other pet services.
Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in national parks. What is a service animal?
Service animals are welcome everywhere at Arches National Park. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted "dog on trail" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own. You can get water at Devils Garden or the visitor center.
Read more about accessibility in the park.

Badlands
==========

Pets are permitted in Badlands National Park with some restrictions. Pets cannot be left unattended.  While visiting the park, pets must be kept on a leash no more than six feet in length at all times. Pets are only allowed in developed areas, such as campgrounds and picnic areas, and other areas open to motor vehicles, such as gravel and paved roadways, roadway corridors, and parking lots. Pet etiquette dictates always cleaning up animal waste and disposing of it in trash receptacles.
Pets are prohibited from hiking trails, public buildings (i.e. visitor centers), and backcountry areas, including the Badlands Wilderness Area and areas with prairie dog colonies. Leaving your animal unattended or tied to a fixed object is prohibited, as well as a danger to  your pet.
Keep in mind that summer temperatures can be extreme, often reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Even on an 86 degree day, the temperature inside a motor vehicle can quickly reach 134 to 154 degrees.
If your pet needs more room to walk, consider visiting the trails managed by US Forest Service, Buffalo Gap National Grassland, located adjacent to Badlands National Park, where pets are permitted (with some exceptions). For more information contact the Buffalo Gap Visitor Center which is located in Wall at (605) 279-2125.
Service Animals
Service animals are an exception to most pet restrictions and are allowed on trails and in public buildings. Service animals must be kept on a leash at all times and, due to potentially infectious wildlife diseases, are not allowed in areas with prairie dog colonies.
Reasons for Pet Restrictions
The park prohibits pets in the Wilderness area, other backcountry areas, on hiking trails, and in areas closed to motor vehicles for the following reasons:

Pets, such as dogs and cats, can carry disease into the park’s wildlife populations. In turn, infectious diseases in wildlife can be transmitted to visiting animals.
Pets can chase and threaten wildlife, scaring birds and other animals away from nesting, feeding, and resting sites. The scent left behind by an animal can signal the presence of a predator, disrupting or altering the behavior of park wildlife.
Pets may be injured by park wildlife, such as rattlesnakes and porcupines, or may become prey for predators, such as coyotes.
During the summer season, hiking trails and popular visitor areas can become congested. Many dogs and strangers do not mix well, presenting a danger to other visitors. Many people, especially small children are frightened by dogs, even small ones.
Dogs bark and disturb the quiet of the Badlands. Unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells can disturb even the calmest, friendliest, and best-trained dog, causing them to behave unpredictably or bark excessively.

Big Bend
==========

Activities with pets are limited in Big Bend: they are not allowed on trails, off roads, or along the river.

Regulations for Pets in the Park:
Having a pet with you may limit some of your activities and explorations in the park.
For the safety of your pet, other people, and park wildlife, please obsrve the following regulations.

Pets are not allowed on trails, off roads, or on the river. Your pet can only go where your car can go.
Pets need to be on a leash no longer than six feet in length (or in a cage) at all times.
You may not leave your pet unattended in vehicles if it creates a danger to the animal, or if the animal becomes a public nuisance.
If you plan to hike or take a river trip, someone must stay behind with the pet, or you will need to make arrangements with a kennel service. There is no kennel service in the park.
Pet etiquette and park regulations require that you always clean up after your pet and dispose of waste in trash receptacles.

"Why aren't pets allowed on trails?"
For many visitors, seeing wildlife is a highlight of a national park visit. Unfortunately, the mere presence of pets in the park alters the natural behavior of native wildlife. In national parks, the native species have priority.

Odors left behind by dogs may prevent wildlife from returning to important habitats such as fan palm oases.
Sensitive archeological sites are often difficult to see and may inadvertently be disturbed by inquisitive four-legged visitors.
The safety of your pet is important as well.Abundant cactus spines, rattlesnakes, and thorns are good reasons not to let your pet roam free. Dogs are natural hunters, but can easily become the hunted. Predators such as coyotes and mountain lions can kill pets, even during daylight hours.
Even though your pet follows instructions and is very well behaved, others do not know your pet and may feel uneasy when encountering an unleashed animal.
By following the park’s simple regulations and respecting fellow visitors, you and your pet can have a happy and healthy park outing.

Service Animals

Qualified service animals assisting people with disabilities are allowed throughout the park and in all park facilities. However, they must be leashed.

Biscayne
==========

Pets are welcome on the grounds surrounding the visitor center and the developed areas of Elliott Key as long as they are on a leash and attended. With the exception of service animals, pets are prohibited in other islands of the park.

Pets are not used to fending for themselves and need access to fresh water, food and pest-free habitat which the park does not provide. Animals abandoned in the park are likely to perish from dehydration or starvation.
To help an animal find a proper place to live, contact a local rescue such as the Humane Society, This is the Dog!, Pet Partners Rescue Home, Marrvelous Pet Rescues and Born Free Shelter. It is a crime to abandon an animal in Miami-Dade County.
Loose pets are a danger to park resources. Loose cats, for example, kill wild birds.
Spay or neuter pets and keep them in safe habitat.

Bryce Canyon
==========

Pets are wonderful animals that give comfort and companionship. However, a national park is not the best place for them. They may chase, scare, or transmit diseases to wild animals. Many pets leave behind a "predator" scent that can linger in the area for long periods of time and can disrupt or alter the behavior of the native animals this park has been set aside to protect.
If you choose to bring a pet to the park, please observe the following regulations:

Pets are permitted on all paved surfaces in the park: campgrounds, parking lots, paved roads, paved viewpoint areas, on the paved trail between Sunset Point and Sunrise Point, and on the paved Shared Use Path between the park entrance and Inspiration Point.
Pets are not permitted on unpaved trails or viewpoints, in public buildings or on public transportation vehicles. These regulations also apply to pets that are carried.
Pets must be on a leash at all times; the leash must be no longer than 6 feet.
Pet owners may not leave pet(s) unattended or tied to an object.
Pets may not make unreasonable noise.
Pet owners are required to pick-up after their pets (excrement and other solid waste).

Pet owners not adhering to regulations may be cited (minimum fine is $75). 36-CFR 2.15 provides more details concerning pets within National Park Service areas.
Kennels near Bryce Canyon are located in Panguitch (30 mi, 48 km), Richfield (100 mi, 160 km), Cedar City (85 mi, 136 km), and Kanab (74 mi, 119 km).

Canyonlands
==========

Pets are welcome at Canyonlands, but activities with pets are very limited. Pets must be leashed at all times. Please clean up after your pet.
You may have your pet with you:

at Island in the Sky (Willow Flat) and The Needles (Squaw Flat) campgrounds
on paved scenic drives and parking lots
on the Potash/Shafer Canyon road between Moab and Island in the Sky

You may not have your pet with you:

at overlooks
on any hiking trails
anywhere in the backcountry
on the rivers
on any backcountry roads, even if it stays in your vehicle

Important!
The desert can be deadly for pets. Car temperatures rise quickly in the sun, even on cool days. Your pet can easily die of heat exhaustion. If you are leaving a pet in a car, crack the windows as much as possible and leave water to drink. We recommend you not leave pets in the car at all when temperatures are above 68°F (20°C), even with the windows cracked.
Pet Boarding
It may be easier to explore the park if you leave your pet at home or board it at a nearby kennel. The town of Moab has kennels with boarding service.
Other Local Services
Visit discovermoab.com for a listing of nearby kennels, veterinarians, and other pet services.
Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in national parks. What is a service animal?
Service animals are permitted everywhere in Canyonlands. Owners are encouraged to identify their working service animal, such as with a vest. Identification is not required, but helps prevent unwarranted "dog on trail" complaints from other visitors. There are no plastic bags provided at trailheads for waste products, so please bring your own.

Carlsbad Caverns
==========

Traveling with Pets

In the concession-run kennel, only water is provided, but you may bring in bedding for your pet's comfort. NPS

Be aware that desert temperatures, thorny vegetation, and predators may be a serious threat to your pet's well-being.

Please consider the following points before deciding to bring a pet:

Pets are not allowed in the cavern, on park trails, off road, at bat flight, or in the visitor center.

Pets need to be on a leash no longer than six feet in length when outside your vehicle.

You are not allowed to leave your pet unattended in vehicles if the outdoor temperature will reach 70ºF (21ºC) and above, as it creates a danger to the animal. On warm days temperatures in closed motor vehicles can rise quickly to levels dangerous to the life and health of animals. Unattended pets will be removed from vehicles at the discretion of law enforcement if the animal is showing signs of distress.

Pet etiquette and park regulations require that you always clean up after your pet and dispose of waste in trash receptacles.

Kennel Information
The park concessioner, Carlsbad Caverns Trading Company, operates a kennel service where you may leave your pet in a temperature controlled environment while you tour the cave. The kennel is for day use only—no overnight stays.

Fee: $10/day

Rabies Vaccine Requirement: Owners are required to provide verification of a rabies vaccine with the expiration date when boarding a pet.

Operating Hours: 8:30 am–4:30 pm (Labor Day weekend through the Friday before Memorial Day weekend) and 8:30 am–6:30 pm (Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day).

Reservations are not accepted. This service is provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

They rarely run out of cage space, but if they do, the larger cages go first. There are three sizes of cages, length x height x width:

49" x 37" x 44"
47" x 24" x 32"
47" x 24" x 24"

Pets are kept in cages relative to their size, such as a small dog in a small cage. Water is provided for the pet, but the owner must provide food or bedding if they feel it's needed.

The concessioner accepts no responsibility for injuries that might occur during a pet's stay in the kennels.

Employees do not handle pets and do not remain in the kennel room with the pets.

If you have more specific questions, contact the Carlsbad Caverns Trading Company at 575-785-2281.

Channel Islands
==========

In order to protect island wildlife, pets are not allowed in the park. Please leave your pets at home.
Some of the diseases and parasites that now threaten the fox may have been carried to the islands by animals from the mainland. While a domestic dog might have immunity from certain parasites and diseases, it may still carry them. Due to their insular existence, island foxes have no such built-up immunity to many of these ailments and are quite vulnerable to them. So please help protect the island fox and other island animals by leaving pets at home.

Service Animals
Service animals are welcome in the mainland visitor center. All domestic animals, including service animals, present a risk of introducing pathogens to the islands. Due to the inherent isolation of the islands, species there may not have immunity to diseases and parasites to which domestic animals have resistance. Service animals will be allowed when they have satisfied a protocol of vaccination, parasite prevention, and health exam to ensure they will not compromise the health of island species. For more information, please call the Chief Ranger at 805-658-5717.

Congaree
==========

 Congaree National Park welcomes all visitors and their pets! Before you come out to the park, here are a few things that you should keep in mind:

Pets are allowed on all trails, including the boardwalk, as well as in the campgrounds.
All pets must be on a leash (6 feet long maximum) and under your control at all times. Please make sure your pet is not jumping on other visitors or running loose.
Pets may not be left unattended for any period of time.
Please be a responsible pet owner and clean up after your pet! Pet waste bags are available outside of the visitor center for your use if you need them.

Crater Lake
==========

Pets are welcome at Crater Lake National Park, but only in certain areas.

Pets on leash are allowed on paved roads and in parking lots, and up to 50 feet away from paved areas. One great place to walk your dog is along the 1/4-mile paved promenade at Rim Village, where you (and your dog) can get fine views of the lake. You can also walk your dog through the campground at Mazama Village.

Leashes must be no more than 6 feet in length, and only one pet per hiker is allowed. Solid waste must be picked up immediately and disposed of properly (in a trash can or toilet).

Pets are also allowed on a few of the park's hiking trails, although none of these trails have a view of the lake:

- The Godfrey Glen Trail
- The Lady of the Woods Trail
- The Grayback Drive
- The Pacific Crest Trail (the official PCT, not the "alternate" PCT along the rim of the lake)

Pets are not allowed on other park trails or off-trail. They are also not allowed inside park buildings, including Crater Lake Lodge and The Cabins at Mazama Village. Service animals are exempt from these regulations. Service dogs are allowed on park trails and also on boat tours.

You may leave your pet, unattended, inside your vehicle (provided that the conditions inside your vehicle do not pose a threat to the animal's health). You may not leave your pet unattended outside your vehicle, tied to a tree or car. There are no kenneling services in the park. The closest kennels are one hour away in Klamath Falls.

Cuyahoga Valley
==========

Protect your pet, other visitors, and park resources by following these guidelines and regulations:

Paw Patrol Volunteer Ruth and dog Roxy stand in front of the Boston Store Visitor Center NPS / Ted Toth

Regulations

Pets must be restrained on a leash that is six feet or shorter in length on all park lands at all times.
Pets should not be left unattended. Summer sunshine poses a threat to pets in vehicles.
Human companions are responsible for cleaning up and depositing pet waste in trash receptacles.

Where Are Pets Allowed?

There are over 110 miles of hiking trails and 20 of the Towpath Trail in the park where pets are permitted.
Pets are permitted in the Stanford Campground

Where are Pets Not Allowed?

In any park building, with the exception of service dogs
On the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad Train
On the East Rim mountain bike trails

Pet Safety

Keeping pets on trail and on leash will minimize exposure to poison ivy and ticks.
Restrictions on pets in parks are as much to protect your pet as to protect park resources.
Use extra caution when hiking in icy and snowy conditions with pets.
Carrying extra water is advised, especially during hot months and long trips

Tick Safety
Ticks can be found in tall grasses, on ground cover, and near structures and woodpiles. They cannot jump, fly, or fall from trees but will attach to pets and people as they walk by. The tick population is high this year. Ticks are active from early spring until late fall. The risk of exposure to ticks and disease can be reduced by using these precautions.

Consider purchasing tick prevention products for your pets, like tick collars, sprays, and gels. Talk to your local veterinarian for more guidance.
Avoid wooded or weedy areas on trails
Tuck pants into socks or boots
Wear light-colored clothing to easily find ticks
Use repellents and follow label instructions
Check children and pets for ticks after hiking or playing outside
Remove ticks as soon as you find them.

If you are bitten by a tick, do not panic. Carefully remove the tick, including its mouth parts, from your skin using tweezers . Monitor your health the following days.

For more information on ticks visit the Ohio Department of Natural Resources webpage.
Service Animals

Service animals may accompany their owner to all park locations.

Death Valley
==========

Are you visiting the park with your pet? Learn from Bark Ranger Frosty where you can take your pet for a safe and fun visit.
Visit Death Valley with your Pet

NPS/Hoerner

Pets in the Park
Pets can go (on a leash no more than 6 feet):

along roads
in campgrounds
in picnic areas
in other developed areas

Pets CAN'T go:

on trails
into the Wilderness
inside most buildings
out of developed areas

Although pets are welcome in Death Valley National Park,there are many restrictions for the safety of park resources, wildlife, other visitors, and even your pet. You may take your pet along roads, to campgrounds, picnic areas, and other developed areas of the park, but they must be restrained or kept on a leash no longer than 6 feet at all times. Other than service animals, pets are not allowed inside most buildings or on trails (including to Zabriskie Point).
Pets can have a negative impact on the park. Dogs in particular might scare or chase wildlife, pollute water sources and can become defensive and dangerous in strange surroundings. Domestic animals can spread diseases to wildlife, and vice versa. Pet owners are responsible for cleaning up their pet's feces and disposing of them properly.
Likewise, the desert can be a dangerous place for pets. Coyotes have been known to lure unsuspecting pets away, to be either killed or lost. Rattlesnakes may alert humans to keep a safe distance, but most pets are unaware of the danger. Spiny plants and hot, rough ground surfaces can be painful or damaging to your pet's bare foot pads. Desert heat and aridity can take a toll on pets and humans. Remember to always provide drinking water and never leave your pet alone in a closed vehicle, which can quickly become deadly hot.
Staying Overnight with a Pet
Pets are allowed in all park campgrounds, but must be restrained at all times. No more than 4 pets per campsite area allowed. Pet owners should be good neighbors by keeping their pets quiet, cleaning up pet feces, and never leaving their pets unattended. Food and water bowls must not be left outside.
Pet-friendly lodging in the park is available at Stovepipe Wells Village and Panamint Springs Resort, but extra fees are charged. Other than service animals, pets are not allowed in guest rooms at The Oasis at Death Valley.
Walking your Pet in the Park
Almost all national parks prohibit pets on trails and in the Wilderness, but pets are allowed on roads. Walking with Fido (on leash, of course) along one of Death Valley's many scenic backcountry roads can be a rewarding alternative to trails. Many of the minor dirt roads receive light traffic, are surrounded by wilderness and seem like two parallel footpaths. Just remember to take your pet safely off to the roadside when a vehicle comes along.
Suggested Walks
Near developed areas

Furnace Creek Airport Road: Starting near the Visitor Center, this level, 1-mile paved road edges the golf course to the airport. WARNING: coyotes are regularly seen in this area.
Bicycle Path to Harmony Borax Works: Paralleling Hwy 190 north of the visitor center for 1mile, this is the only trail in the park open to pets. The interpretive trail around Harmony Borax Works ruins is closed to pets, but those looking for a longer walk can continue on the unpaved Mustard Canyon Road.
Stovepipe Wells Airport Road: From the Stovepipe Wells Campground entrance this unpaved road heads across the valley floor to the airport and access to the Cottonwood Canyon Road.

In the backcountry

Twenty Mule Team Canyon Road: This 3-mile, one-way dirt road passes through colorful, other-worldly badlands. Vehicles may be restricted to traveling only one direction, but hikers can choose to turn around at any time.
Titus Canyon Road: The hike up the narrows of Titus Canyon is one of the most popular in Death Valley and because it is on a dirt road you can bring your pet along. The first 1.5 miles is the narrowest, but you can continue for miles if you like. Spectacular scenery is the main reason to hike here, but the local herd of native bighorn sheep is why you should keep your pet under tight control.
Echo Canyon Road: Although the first part of this road is in the open, if you have a high-clearance, 2WD vehicle you can drive 3 miles to the canyon mouth, then walk with your pet through the 2 mile long canyon narrows to a natural arch and beyond.
Chloride City Road: This mid-elevation road is a good option when the temperatures are starting to get too warm in the valley. From the Daylight Pass Road, walk the narrow dirt road winding through desert hills to Monarch Canyon (2 miles.)

Other public lands
Death Valley National Park is surrounded by public lands that have less restrictive rules regarding pets. Contact the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Ridgecrest, CA or Battle Mountain, NV and the U.S.Forest Service / Inyo National Forest in Lone Pine or Bishop, CA for current regulations.

Pets are Allowed in Limited Areas in Everglades National Park

Due to the concern for wildlife management issues, Everglades' regulation allows the closing of an area to the use of pets and service animals, if it is determined that these pose a direct threat to the health or safety of people or wildlife.

Pets present in areas not permitted open themselves to predation by wildlife, as well as posing a significant danger to the handler and other visitors.
Where Can I Bring my Pet?
Pets must be kept on a leash (maximum of 6 feet in length) at all times. Do not leave pets unattended. Please pick up after your pet and dispose in a sealed container.
Pets are permitted in the following areas:

Roadways open to public vehicular traffic

Things To Do

Safety

Learn about safety concerns of your trip in northern Alaska's premier wilderness

Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is a vast and essentially untouched wilderness park – with no roads, no trails, and no established campsites. The park has no set routes in place and visitors may wander at will across 8.4 million acres of superlative natural beauty. This is a place for discovery and exploration.
There are no established services within the park boundaries and only limited means of communication work effectively to contact anyone for assistance. Cell phones don’t work here.
Visitors to the park should be PROFICIENT in outdoor survival skills, and be prepared to care for their own life and their partner(s) if an emergency arises.
The terrain is challenging: there are no established trails and the dense vegetation, tussocks, boggy ground, and frequent stream and river crossings can significantly slow progress across the landscape . Experienced hikers consider six miles a good day’s travel in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.
If visitors are not proficient in wilderness back country skills, we recommend that they contact an outfitter, guide service, or air taxi operator for assistance.
For those visitors who don’t have the time, or the backcountry skills to mount an expedition into the park, there are other options. Local air taxis provide flight-seeing trips, day trips or overnight camp outs at remote locations. Imagine a day spent fishing at an alpine lake, or watching the caribou up in the northern valleys, or sitting alongside a wild river listening to the wind in the boreal forest. Air taxis will also take visitors into neighboring Kobuk Valley National Park to get their passport stamp.
Whatever trip option you choose, be prepared for the experience of a lifetime.

Traveling in a remote wilderness park requires visitors to be self sufficient and flexible.

You need to arrive at your jumping off point with everything you need for a safe and comfortable trip.
Bush travel requires flexibility.  There are many reasons for delays going in and out of the park.  You should take enough food to remain in the park several extra days.  It is also a good idea to have a back up route plan with maps just in case.
Before you leave for your trip, contact the Park and Preserve for updates and advisories.
Visitors in the park must practice minimum impact techniques, adhere to Leave No Trace principles, follow backcountry safety guidelines, and be aware of the fragile ecosystems and private lands within the park.
Before you go into the backcountry, stop by the Bettles Ranger Station, Coldfoot Arctic Interagency Visitor Center, Marion Creek Ranger Station (near Coldfoot), or Anaktuvuk Pass Ranger Station for a backcountry orientation.
 We request that you fill out the voluntary Back Country Registration Form.
You will also have the opportunity to check out Bear Resistant Food Containers (BRFCs) at these locations. BRFCs are the easiest way to meet the mandatory food storage regulations for all overnight visitors in the Park.

Also visit our Backpacking & Hiking and Wild & Scenic Rivers pages to plan your trip.

Visit the Basic Information page for operating hours and seasons, permits and reservations, and bringing pets to the park.

Lots of information for your visit, all packed into easily downloadable and printable PDF files! Please feel free to phone (907-692-5494) or email us if you have any questions that are not answered by this material.

Special rules apply to our four-footed friends. NPS/Bill Hayden

Pets are members of our families, but there are some things you should be aware of before bringing your pet to the park.

Pets are allowed in developed areas, in frontcountry campgrounds and picnic areas, along roads, in parking areas, and in boats on lakes where motorized watercraft are permitted.

Pets are not permitted on trails, along lake shores, in the backcountry, or in any building.

Pets must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet (1.8 m), under physical restraint, or caged at all times, including while in open-bed pickup trucks.

Pets are not to be left tied to an object when unattended.

Pet owners must pick up after their pets and dispose of waste in a trash receptacle. Owners must not allow a pet to make noise that is unreasonable. When the bike path between Apgar and West Glacier is free of snow dogs are allowed on leash.
When roads are closed to vehicle traffic, they are considered a backcountry trail and dogs are not allowed.

Glacier Bay
==========

Glacier Bay National Park is a sanctuary for Alaskan wildlife and may not be the best location to bring a pet. Pets are allowed on land in only a few select areas, and may not be left unattended. Your pet must be leashed or physically restrained at all times. Pets are not allowed on trails, beaches, or anywhere in the backcountry, with the exception of pets that remain on board private vessels on the water.
Pets are allowed:

On the Bartlett Cove Public Use Dock
On the beach between the Bartlett Cove Public Use Dock and the National Park Service Administrative Dock
Within 100 feet of Bartlett Cove Developed Area park roads or parking areas unless otherwise posted
On a vessel on the water

Keep Bartlett Cove Clean!
All pet waste must be cleaned up and deposited within the covered trash cans in Bartlett Cove.
Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in all facilities and on trails unless an area has been closed by the superintendent to protect park resources.
The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal” as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric,
intellectual, or other mental disability. Dogs that are not trained to perform tasks that mitigate the effects of a disability, including dogs that are used to purely provide comfort or emotional support (therapy animals) are considered pets.
Service animals in training and pets are subject to the park's pet regulations and are not allowed on trails, boardwalks, or in the backcountry. Falsely potraying a pet as a service animal is considered fraud and is subject to federal prosecution.
Things to know
Where domestic animals and wildlife overlap there is a possibility of exchanging diseases between the two groups. Domestic dogs can introduce disease into wildlife habitats and the park’s canids (wolves, coyotes, and foxes) are vulnerable to domestic diseases such as canine distemper, parvo virus, rabies, mange, etc. Likewise it’s possible for domestic dogs to acquire these diseases from wild animals.

To further prevent the spread of disease:
•Service animals must always be leashed or harnessed, under control, and attended at all times.
•Pet food is a bear attractant and must be stored accordingly. Food and food containers must never be left unattended and must be kept out of reach of wildlife.
•Service animal fecal matter must be picked up and disposed of properly.
Risks
Please be aware that having a service animal in the backcountry may put you at increased risk for confrontations with wolves, bears, and other wildlife. Wolves are very territorial and may perceive domestic dogs as competitors and act aggressively toward them putting you and your animal in danger. If you must take a service animal with you in the backcountry keep it on a tight leash at all times and sleep with it in your tent at night.

Grand Canyon
==========

On the South Rim, leashed pets are allowed on trails above the rim.

Pets in Grand Canyon National Park
Grand Canyon National Park was established to preserve an amazing variety of landscapes, plants and wildlife and to provide a place for people to enjoy wilderness. How do pets fit in with this mandate?

Pets can harass or harm wild animals by making noise, chasing them or catching them.

Pets can intimidate and disturb other visitors by making noise or scaring wildlife away.

Pets can damage the ground and plants by digging or rolling.

Pets can attract predators such as cougars or coyotes looking for easy meals.

Where can I visit with my pet?

To help everyone enjoy the park and for the safety of you, your pet, and park wildlife, the following regulations apply in Grand Canyon National Park. Rules differ on neighboring national forest and state land.

Pets must be leashed (up to 6 feet) at all times.

On the South Rim, leashed pets are allowed on trails above the rim, Mather Campground, Desert View Campground, Trailer Village, and throughout developed areas.

Yavapai Lodge is the only in-park lodge that has pet friendly rooms.

Pets may also be boarded at the South Rim Kennel.

Pets are not permitted:

Below the rim (inner canyon trails).

On park shuttle buses.

On the North Rim, leashed pets are only allowed on the bridle trail (greenway) that connects the North Kaibab Trail, and the portion of the Arizona Trail north to the park entrance station. There is no Kennel on the North Rim.

At Tuweep, leashed pets are only allowed on established roads and the campground.

To ensure you and your pets have a great visit check out the following tips:

Do not leave pets tied or unattended outside or in your vehicle.
Pet excrement must be immediately collected and disposed of in the nearest trash can.
During the summer, high temperatures and elevation can affect your pet, ensure your pet has enough water, snacks, and paw protection from the hot rim pavement.

Grand Canyon Kennel (South Rim) 928-638-0534
Operated by Xanterra Parks & Resorts.
Open Daily: 7:30 am - 5 pm   365 days a year
Owners dropping off or picking up outside of business hours, must go in person to Maswik Lodge to make arrangments

Pets are not permitted in most guestrooms in the lodges on the South Rim and must be boarded at the kennel. The kennel accepts dogs and cats only, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily and reservations are recommended (especially for the summer months and holidays). Pets are accepted for day or overnight boarding and food is included.

Proof of vaccination must be provided upon entering the kennel.

Dogs need proof of current inoculation against rabies, DHLP, bordetella, and parvo.
Cats need proof of current inoculation against rabies, feline leukemia, and distemper combo (FDVR).
* Feline leukemia vaccination proof not required for indoor cats, with a doctor's note.

The park kennel is located on the South Rim near Maswik Lodge.

Tasks performed by service animals must be directly related to the handler's disability.

What Are Service Animals?

"Service animal means any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service animals for the purposes of this definition.

The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to, assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds, providing non-violent protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, assisting an individual during a seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors.

The crime deterrent effects of an animal's presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship do not constitute work or tasks for the purposes of this definition."
- The Americans with Disabilities Act

Grand Teton
==========

Pet Safety & Regulations

To ensure that you and your pet enjoy a safe visit, follow all pet regulations while inside the park. Wildlife may be drawn to pets and their owners. Pets can wander away and may never be found. The park is a wild place! These regulations are enforced to protect you, park resources and other visitors. See the pet brochure for a map and additional safety and regulations information.
Pets are allowed inside Grand Teton National Park, but they must be restrained at all times and are not permitted on hiking trails, inside visitor centers or other facilities. A good rule of thumb is that a pet may go anywhere a car may go: roads and road shoulders, campgrounds and picnic areas, parking lots, etc. Pets must be on a leash (six feet or less), under physical restraint, and within 30 feet of the roadway. Pets are not permitted on any park trails or in the park backcountry. Pets are not considered pack animals.

Regulations

You are responsible for clean-up and disposal of all pet feces.
Pets must be kept under physical control at all times - caged, crated, or restrained on a leash not to exceed six feet in length.
Pets are prohibited in the backcountry and on park trails.
Pets are prohibited from public buildings and swimming beaches, except for guide dogs.
Pets are prohibited from riding in boats on park waters, except for Jackson Lake.
Pets must stay within 30 feet of any roadway.
Pets must not be left unattended and/or tied to an object.
Pets are prohibited from making unreasonable noise or frightening wildlife.
Pets running-at-large may be impounded and their owner charged for the care and feeding.
Pets are not allowed on the park's multi-use pathway.
Service animals used for the sole purpose of aiding a person with a disability are permitted, but should be clearly marked as a working animal. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.

Seasonal Road Closures and Pets
From November 1 through April 30 every year the park closes portions of the Teton Park Road, Antelope Flats and Moose-Wilson Road to motorized traffic, allowing for public recreation.
Leashed dogs are permitted on the Teton Park, Antelope Flats, and Moose-Wilson roads, as well as other park roadways. Dogs are restricted to roads and turnouts - they are not permitted to travel more than 30 feet from roadbeds, or into the park's backcountry. Owners are required to keep pets on a leash (six foot maximum length). Mutt Mitt stations are in place at the Taggart Lake Trailhead parking area. Pet owners are required to pick up after their dogs and dispose of the waste properly.
Kennels and Pet Sitters
If you are planning on exploring areas of the park that are closed to pets, we recommend that you contact a local pet care provider. Commercial kennels and pet sitters are available in surrounding communities. Please check local listings. Reservations are strongly advised and may be required.

Great Basin
==========

Please be aware that having a pet with you will limit your activities in Great Basin National Park.  Kennel services are available in the neigboring town of Baker, NV. Click on this link for more information .
Be aware of the following regulations before deciding to bring your pet:

Pets must be kept on a leash 6 feet in length or shorter at all times. This is for the protection of the pet, wildlife, and other visitors.
Pets are not permitted in Lehman Caves or at evening programs.
Pets are not permitted on trails or in the backcountry of the park, except leashed pets on the Lexington Arch Trail or the trail between Baker and the Great Basin Visitor Center.
(Please note: the unimproved dirt road to Lexington Arch is rough and rutted, requiring a high clearance, four-wheel drive vehicle and advanced driving skills to reach the trailhead. Some parts of the road may be impassable due to flood damage. Route finding may be necessary.)
Leashed pets can only be exercised in the campgrounds, in front of the visitor centers, and along roads.
Pet owners are required to immediately remove and properly dispose of fecal matter deposited by their pets. Deposit bags of fecal matter in a dumpster.
Pets may not be left unattended at campsites or tied to trees or other fixtures.

Why are there restrictions on pets in National Parks?
A national park is a refuge for native wildlife.  Restrictions are intended to prevent stress and molestation of wildilfe, to protect pets from wildlife that may attack or harm them, and to provide an enjoyable experience for those visitors without pets.  Domestic animals can also spread diseases to other wildlife through feces and other bodily fluids.

Great Sand Dunes
==========

During summer months, plan to take your dog in the dunes only during early morning or evening hours, or stay in Medano Creek. Sand temperatures can reach over 150 degrees F. NPS/Patrick Myers

We want your visit to Great Sand Dunes to be a positive, safe experience for you and your pet. Following these guidelines will protect you, your pet, wildlife, natural resources, and other visitors.

On this map of the main frontcountry area of the park, blue shading indicates where pets are not permitted.
Where are pets permitted?

Pets are permitted in the Preserve (including Mosca Pass Trail) and main use areas of the Park, including Piñon Flats Campground, Dunes Overlook Trail, and along the Medano Pass Primitive Road.  They must be leashed at all times and owners must clean up after them. Please carry out waste.

Where are pets not permitted?
Pets are not permitted:
• In the backcountry of the dunefield,
beyond the first high ridge of dunes
• Off of the Dunes Overlook Trail
• Inside the visitor center
• North of Castle Creek Picnic Area, except along Medano Pass Primitive Road
• North of Point of No Return,
including Sand Ramp Trail and
national park backpacking sites

Never leave your dog in your vehicle during warmer months.

Your Pet's Safety
• Hot Sand Temperatures  In summer months, extreme sand surface temperatures up to 150 degrees F can occur from late morning through late afternoon.  Plan to hike on the dunes in early morning or evening in summer months.  Protect your pet’s feet with socks or pet booties.  Watch your pet carefully for signs of heat exhaustion.  When Medano Creek is flowing, keep your pet close to the cool, wet sand for relief. Bring a water bowl to give your pet water on your hike.

• Vehicles   Do not leave pets unattended in your vehicle.  Summer temperatures in a vehicle can quickly soar to dangerous levels. Extreme cold temperatures in the winter can also pose a danger to your pet.

• Cactus Spines   The desert grasslands surrounding the dunes contain prickly pear cactus.  If you walk your pet in the grasslands, walk slowly and carefully to to avoid injury to your pet from the sharp spines. Consider carrying tweezers or pliers.

• Dangers from Wildlife   Keeping your pet on a leash less than six feet long is the best protection against wildlife.  Pets may not be left tied to vehicles, trees or other objects. To prevent injuries, do not allow your pet to get close to a wild animal.  Deer may kick, mountain lions or bears may attack, coyotes may chase, badgers may bite, and porcupines may release quills. On rare occasions, coyotes or other animals may approach your leashed pet.  Raise your arms and shout loudly; coyotes will typically run away.  Please report any unusual encounters to a park ranger.  Never leave pet food out in your picnic site or campsite, as it may attract wild animals.
Protecting the Park and Other Visitors

Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is one of only a few national parks that permits pets in many areas.  Responsible pet ownership in the park and preserve will enable the park to continue to allow you to visit with your pets in the future. Pet owners violating park regulations may be cited and/or fined.

Great Smoky Mountains
==========

Dogs must be on a leash at all times while in the park. Heidi Weimer photo

Dogs are allowed in campgrounds, picnic areas, and along roads, but must be kept on a leash at all times. The leash must not exceed 6 feet in length. Dogs are only allowed on two short walking paths—the Gatlinburg Trail and the Oconaluftee River Trail. Pets are not allowed on any other park trails. Pet excrement must be immediately collected by the pet handler and disposed of in a trash receptacle. Pets should not be left unattended in vehicles or RVs.
.
Why Are Dogs Prohibited on National Park Trails?
Large national parks that have extensive backcountry areas as a rule do not allow dogs on trails. These include parks such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier, Rocky Mountains, and several others. Great Smoky Mountains National Park has prohibited dogs in the backcountry since the park was first established in the 1930s. The park prohibits dogs on hiking trails for several reasons:
• Dogs can carry disease into the park's wildlife populations.
• Dogs can chase and threaten wildlife, scaring birds and other animals away from nesting, feeding, and resting sites. The scent left behind by a dog can signal the presence of a predator, disrupting or altering the behavior of park wildlife. Small animals may hide in their burrow the entire day after smelling a dog and may not venture out to feed.
• Dogs bark and disturb the quiet of the wilderness. Unfamiliar sights, sounds, and smells can disturb even the calmest, friendliest, and best-trained dog, causing them to behave unpredictably or bark excessively.
• Pets may become prey for larger predators such as coyotes and bears. In addition, if your dog disturbs and enrages a bear, it may lead the angry bear directly to you. Dogs can also encounter insects that bite and transmit disease and plants that are poisonous or full of painful thorns and burrs.
• Many people, especially children, are frightened by dogs, even small ones. Uncontrolled dogs can present a danger to other visitors.
.
Since I Can't Hike With My Pet in the National Park, Where Else Can I Go?
The Southern Highlands region offers an amazing variety of federal public lands for recreation and enjoyment. Some public lands outside the Smokies offer a wider range of recreational opportunities than are available here, including hiking with your pet.

Guadalupe Mountains
==========

Pets are prohibited:

in park buildings

in restrooms

at public programs

in the backcountry

on ALL park trails except the Pinery Trail and the trail from the Pine Springs Campground to the visitor center

Where Pets Can Go
Leashed pets are permitted in Guadalupe Mountains National Park only in areas accessed by vehicles, including established roadsides, parking areas, frontcountry picnic areas and frontcountry campgrounds. Leashed pets may walk on the short trail between the campground and the Pine Springs Visitor Center or along the Pinery Trail from the visitor center to the Butterfield Stage Station. They must be kept on a leash no longer than six feet and attended at all times. Federal regulations require all pet excrement to be picked up and diposed of in a marked trash recepacle.
Why Can't I Hike With My Dog or Cat?

Dogs and cats are considered to be unnatural predators in a natural environment
Pets may harass and even kill wildlife, carry disease and disrupt the habitats of native species in the park
Pets could become prey for larger carnivores like mountain lions, black bears, bobcats, coyote packs or many other desert animals which could pose a threat to your pet
Many Chihuahuan desert plants are spiny or poisonous and can easily injure a pet
Pets can bite visitors or intrude on the visitor experience anticipated in Guadalupe Mountains National Park

Other Park Pet Rules
Do not leave pets unattended at campsites, tied to an object in the park, or in vehicles for prolonged peroids of time. Interior vehicle temperatures can rise within minutes and pets can quickly overheat and die, even with the windows cracked. The nearest kennel service (with limited hours) is at Carlsbad Caverns National Park.

Some adjacent US Forest Service lands do allow leashed pets on trails and in the backcountry. Contact them directly for details and specific locations.

Service Animals
Service Animals as defined by titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act are excepted and are permitted in park buildings, restrooms, at public programs, and in the backcountry; service animals that have been individually trained to perform specific tasks for the benefit of persons with disabilities are allowed in the park.

Emotional support (“therapy animals”) are not service animals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and may not access trails or other non-motorized areas.

Indiana Dunes
==========

Pets are members of our families, but there are some things you should be aware of before bringing your pet to the park.
Guidelines

Pets must be restrained on a leash no longer than 6 feet (2 meters).
Pet owners are responsible for removing pet waste everywhere in the park.
Pets are not allowed on the Pinhook Bog Trail, but are allowed on the Pinhook Upland Trail.
Pets are not allowed on the equestrian portion of the Glenwood Dunes Trail system.

Pets should not be left unattended in a vehicle, especially in the summer. High temperatures in a car can kill pets.

Service animals are an exception to these rules and may accompany their owner to all park locations.

Pets on Beaches

Pets must be on a leash at all times, even when swimming in the lake. Handlers allowing pets to chase birds or otherwise harass wildlife are subject to a citation. Pet handlers are responsible for carrying waste off the beach.
Pets are allowed year round on all beaches with the following exception: Pets are not allowed in the lifeguarded swimming area at West Beach from the Friday of Memorial Day weekend through the Monday of Labor Day Weekend.

Horses

Horses under the direct control of a rider are allowed on specific parts of the Glenwood Dunes trail system. Please visit the Glenwood Dunes trail system webpage for more equestrian information.

Restricted pet areas are marked in red.

Restricted Pet Areas
With the exception of assistance animals, the possession of pets is prohibited in the following areas:

West Beach. Pets are permitted everywhere except for the lifeguard swim area, which is maintained from the Friday of Memorial Day weekend through the Monday of Labor Day weekend.
Glenwood Dunes Trail System. Pets (other than horses) are not permitted on the specific portion of the Glenwood Dunes trail system that is designated for equestrian use. Pets are permitted in the parking lot and other sections of the trail system.
Nature Play Areas. The area are located on the east side of the Paul Douglas Center main parking lot and is delineated by fencing and inside the Mather and Douglas loops at the Dunewood Campground.
Pinhook Bog Trail. Pets are not permitted on the Pinhook Bog Trail. Pets are permitted in the parking lot and on the Pinhook Upland Trail.

Special Events
During large public and other special events, some areas are temporarily closed to pets. Watch for restrictions posted on brown signs at parking areas and entrances to event areas. You may also call the Visitor Center at (219) 395-1882 for information.

Pet restrictions and closures are in place to allow for compatible use of areas, threats to wildlife, damage to sensitive plants and to cooperate with local and state regulations.

Isle Royale
==========

Only service dogs are allowed on Isle Royale. NPS / Wieber

Can I bring my pet to Isle Royale?
Dogs, cats and other mammals are not allowed on the island. This includes pets on boats within the park boundaries, which extend 4 ½ miles into Lake Superior from the outermost land areas of the park. Visitors bringing pets to Isle Royale will be required to leave immediately.

Leashed pets are allowed outdoors at the Houghton Visitor Center and Headquarters complex where the Ranger III departs.

Why can't I bring my pet?
The park's primary concern is for the protection of wildlife species; the inadvertent transmission of disease or parasites into the largely isolated Isle Royale ecosystem could have devastating effects on wildlife populations. In 1980, the park witnessed just such an event, when the canine parvovirus was likely transmitted to the island from a pet dog and infected the wolf population. Wolves on Isle Royale plummented from 50 individiuals down to 14.

Can I bring my service dog to the island?
Service dogs are welcome on Isle Royale. However, a service dog permit must be obtained prior to your trip. Obtaining this permit involves receiving the proper paperwork from the park, consulting a licensed veterinarian no more then 15 days prior to your park visit, and having the permit signed by the park superintendent or representative. Consult the service dog webpage for the specific details. Without the service dog permit, your dog will not be allowed on Isle Royale.

Joshua Tree
==========

Joshua Tree's unpaved backcountry roads have little traffic and are good places to walk leashed dogs. NPS/Brad Sutton

Pets are an important part of our lives, providing companionship, love, and joy to their caretakers. While park regulations do not allow pets to join you on hiking trails, in the backcountry, or in park buildings, there are many great alternative areas to explore on a pet-friendly visit to Joshua Tree National Park.
"Why not take my pet with me?"

For many visitors, seeing wildlife is a highlight of a national park visit. Unfortunately, the mere presence of pets in the park alters the natural behavior of native wildlife. In national parks, the native species have priority.

Odors left behind by dogs may prevent wildlife from returning to important habitats such as fan palm oases.

Sensitive archeological sites are often difficult to see and may inadvertently be disturbed by inquisitive four-legged visitors.

The safety of your pet is important as well.

Abundant cactus spines, rattlesnakes, and thorns are good reasons not to let your pet roam free. Dogs are natural hunters, but can easily become the hunted. Predators such as coyotes and mountain lions can kill pets, even during daylight hours.

Even though your pet follows instructions and is very well behaved, others do not know your pet and may feel uneasy when encountering an unleashed animal.

By following the park’s simple regulations and respecting fellow visitors, you and your pet can have a happy and healthy park outing.

Pet Regulations

Pets must remain on a leash at all times. Leashes may be no longer than 6 feet (1.8 m).
Pets may go no more than 100 feet (30.5 m) from any road, picnic area, or campground.
Owners must pick up any droppings. Leave no trace.
Pets are not permitted on trails or in the backcountry.

Violators of these regulations are subject to fine.

Remember to bring plenty of water for your pet. Leaving pets in unattended vehicles is strongly discouraged – especially on warm days.
Service Animals
The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a “service animal” as an animal that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.

Animals that are not trained to perform tasks that mitigate the effects of a disability, including animals that are used to provide comfort or emotional support (e.g. therapy animals), are considered pets and not service animals.

Service animals in training and pets are subject to the park’s pet regulations and are not allowed on trails or more than 100 feet (30.5m) from any road, picnic area or campground. Falsely portraying a pet as a service animal is considered fraud and is subject to federal prosecution under 36 CFR. 2.32(a)(3)(ii). To learn more, please visit our Accessibility page.

Picnic Areas and Campgrounds
These areas offer many opportunities to experience the park’s diverse scenery with your pet. Pets are also permitted on the paved Oasis of Mara trail. See park map for locations of picnic areas and campgrounds.
Unpaved Roads
Unpaved roads see little vehicle traffic, making them feel a lot like wide trails and a great place to hike with your pet. Anywhere you can drive your vehicle, you can go with your leashed pet.

Some unpaved roads require 4-wheel drive and/or high-clearance vehicles. Be sure you are prepared with food and plenty of water before beginning your trip.

Most roads have pullouts or nearby parking areas where you may park and begin hiking. See park map for locations of unpaved roads.

Katmai
==========

Backcountry Regulations and Suggested Best Practices

Unless otherwise noted, these regulations are in effect in all backcountry areas of Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alagnak Wild River, and Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve. More information on the regulations that help rangers manage, preserve, and protect Katmai can be found in the Laws and Policies pages.

Bear Spray
Bear spray may be carried, possessed and used in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. Contact Katmai National Park and Preserve headquarters to report any use of bear spray on a bear or other wildlife. Accurate and timely reports of bear spray discharges help the park determine whether or not there are any unsafe patterns developing.

Please note that bear spray cannot be carried in the passenger compartments of airplanes. Contact your commercial air carrier or air taxi concerning proper transport.

The core meadows of Hallo Bay are closed from April 1 to October 31. Click on the image to download the map.

Camping
To allow others use of scarce and popular campsites and to reduce lasting impacts to the land, camping in one location for more than 14 consecutive days is prohibited. If you wish to camp longer than 14 days, your second camp must be at least two miles away from your original campsite. The 14 day clock starts as soon as you erect your tent and your tent occupies that campsite. More information on the seasonal camping closures listed below can be found in the Laws & Policies section of this website.

Camping Closure at Hallo Bay
The core meadow areas of Hallo Bay Meadows are closed to camping from April 1st through October 31st to prevent conflicts with bears and visitors at prime feeding sites that attract bears and bear viewers.

Camping Closure at Geographic Harbor
Camping is not permitted at the designated bear viewing site of Geographic Creek from April 1st-October 31st in order to prevent conflicts with bears and visitors at this prime feeding and viewing spot.

Camping is not permitted within a half mile of the confluence of Moraine and Funnel Creek

Camping Closure at Moraine and Funnel Creek Confluence
Between July 1st and August 31st camping is not permitted within one half of a mile upstream and downstream from the confluence of Moraine Creek and Funnel Creek, in order to prevent conflicts between bears and visitors.

Camping Best Practices

Avoid surprise encounters with bears—hike and camp in open areas, avoiding thickets and brush. Do not camp on bear trails.
In heavily visited areas, camp in places that have already been impacted. Not only does this reduce damage to vegetation, it has the added bonus that bears are likely to be less curious about your campsite as they have seen humans in that spot before. Frequently-used campsites include 5 Mile in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, near the ranger camp at Hallo Bay, and scattered sites around Crosswinds Lake.
Erecting an electric fence around your campsite is recommended, though not required. If you do not use a bear fence, tents should be placed in a line to allow bears to pass through.
Camp at least 100 feet away from moving water. Bears commonly use waterways as trail systems, and during the salmon run, bear activity is high along these corridors.
Keep a clean campsite.

Collecting
Nuts, berries, and unoccupied seashells can be collected for personal use. Collecting artifacts, rocks, antlers, or other natural and cultural resources is prohibited. Collecting fossils on state or federal lands is prohibited.

Commercial Operations
Exploring Katmai with the aid of a guide is an excellent way of experiencing the Katmai wilderness, especially if you've never been here before. If you are coming to Katmai with a commercial guide or outfitter, it is a good idea to check with our commercial services program to make sure that the guide/outfitter is authorized to do business in Katmai. Guides must have a commercial use authorization to bring clients into Katmai National Park and Preserve. A list of authorized commercial operators can be found in the commercial services directory.

Firearms
Firearms may be carried and possessed in the Katmai backcountry in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. Firearms may not be used for pointing or aiming (such as to use a scope), target practice or demonstrations, or make warning shots. The park has no facilities for firearms storage and it is a good idea to contact the air taxi, lodge, or guide service to find out what their firearms policy is.

Fires
Fires are allowed but are discouraged due to fire impacts on tundra and archeological and historical resources. Fires must never be left unattended. Cabins and other historical structures are protected. Do not collect wood from these structures. Please use established fire rings if available. Keep fires small and do not burn trash or uneaten food in your fire pit. Check the news page on Katmai's website for information on any potential fire restrictions.
Fishing
Fishing is allowed in accordance with state and federal regulations. Many waterways in the Katmai backcountry have their own set of rules, and Katmai is covered under three different state fishing management areas – Bristol Bay, Kodiak and Lower Cook Inlet. Visit Katmai's fishing page for more information, including links to specific regulations.

Food Storage
The use of bear-resistant food containers (BRFCs) is mandatory in all backcountry areas. For a list of approved BRFCs (including ice chests and coolers), go to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Commitee page, or the ADFG page for BRFCs. A limited supply of BRFCs is available to borrow free of charge at the visitor centers in King Salmon and Brooks Camp. BRFCs can also be purchased or rented at many backpacking/outdoor stores.

Please note, any coolers and dry boxes accepted as BRFCs by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game must be bolted shut or padlocked to be considered bear resistant. Yeti and Igloo coolers without padlocks are not acceptable BRFCs. Soft-sided BRFCs that require hanging from a tree or other fixed object may not be used as a substitute for hard-sided BRFCs.

Food, equipment to cook food, garbage, and items with an odor (such as toothpaste or sunscreen) must be stored in a BRFC except when it is being actively used. Do not store food or odorous items in your tent, even if you are using an electric fence.

If you do have an electric fence, store BRFCs away from the campsite, and cook away from your camping area. A distance of 100 yards is a good general rule.

Sanitation
Be a respectful and responsible backcountry user—dispose of waste properly.

Carry out all trash. Do not burn or bury any trash.
Dump cooking or wastewater away from your camp.
Bury feces in a cathole 6-8 inches deep and replace topsoils to disguise the site. Defecate away from obvious campsites.
Always carry out toilet paper and sanitary supplies.
In heavily used areas, areas with thick vegetation, or in places where is it impracticable to bury human waste, use a "portable toilet in a bag" to contain and dispose of solid human waste. Commercial groups in heavily used areas must use a portable toilet or bag system to remove solid human waste.

Permits
Permits are not required for backcountry travel but it is recommended that a backcountry travel planner be filled out and submitted to the park. Trip planners can be filled out in person at the King Salmon and Brooks Camp visitor centers or online.

Pets are allowed in the backcountry but must be under physical control at all times. Pets and service animals are not allowed within the Brooks Camp Developed Area (BCDA), defined as a 1.5 mile radius from the Brooks Falls Platform, between May 1 and October 31.

Wildlife Distance Conditions/Wildlife Disturbance or Harassment
Approaching a bear or any large mammal within 50 yards is prohibited. Also prohibited:

Continuing to occupy a position within 50 yards of a bear using a concentrated food source (including, but not limited to, animal carcasses, spawning salmon and other feeding areas);
Continuing to fish within 50 yards of a bear;
Feeding, touching, teasing, or disturbing wildlife.

Bear viewing best practices:

Respect a bear's personal space.
Stay in a group when wildlife watching in the backcountry.
Consistently use the same viewing sites.
Promote predictable human behavior.

Remember to Leave No Trace.

The well-being of your pets and park wildlife is of the utmost importance to us. For the safety of all, pets are allowed in only a few select areas, and may not be left unattended. Your pet must be leashed or physically restrained at all times. Please clean up after your pet and dispose of waste properly.
Pets are allowed:

on the road to Exit Glacier (the Herman Leirer Road).
in the parking lot of the Exit Glacier Nature Center.

Pets are not allowed:

on trails, such as the trails of the Exit Glacier area or the Harding Icefield Trail.
in the coastal backcountry.

Pets are not allowed along the coast in an area extending from the mean high tide line to 1/4 mile inland from 5/30 - 11/1.

in any building, regardless of the season.

Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in all facilities and on trails unless an area has been closed by the superintendent to protect park resources.
The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal "as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric,
intellectual, or other mental disability." Dogs which are not trained to perform tasks that mitigate the effects of a disability, including dogs that are used to purely provide comfort or emotional support (therapy animals) are considered pets.

Dog Mushing / Skijoring
Dogs used for mushing or skijoring may be used on the Harding Icefield at any time, and in the Exit Glacier area when the road is closed due to snow and vehicle access is not allowed.

Kings Canyon
==========

Pets and Wildlife

For you and your neighbors to see and appreciate wildlife, please note that pets are not permitted on any trails at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
In campgrounds and picnic areas, pets must be kept on a leash at all times. The leash must be less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. For your pet's safety, please don't leave pets in hot cars. Pets cannot be left tied and unattended at any time.
Nearby Areas where Pets are Permitted
In the national forest lands that surround these parks, leashed pets are allowed on trails. Leashes must be less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. See the map below for locations of national forest areas adjoining Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Giant Sequoia National Monument is administered by the U.S. Forest Service.
Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in national parks, including facilities, trails, and campgrounds.

Safety

Learn about safety concerns of your trip in northern Alaska's premier wilderness

Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve is a vast and essentially untouched wilderness park – with no roads, no trails, and no established campsites. The park has no set routes in place and visitors may wander at will across 8.4 million acres of superlative natural beauty. This is a place for discovery and exploration.
There are no established services within the park boundaries and only limited means of communication work effectively to contact anyone for assistance. Cell phones don’t work here.
Visitors to the park should be PROFICIENT in outdoor survival skills, and be prepared to care for their own life and their partner(s) if an emergency arises.
The terrain is challenging: there are no established trails and the dense vegetation, tussocks, boggy ground, and frequent stream and river crossings can significantly slow progress across the landscape . Experienced hikers consider six miles a good day’s travel in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.
If visitors are not proficient in wilderness back country skills, we recommend that they contact an outfitter, guide service, or air taxi operator for assistance.
For those visitors who don’t have the time, or the backcountry skills to mount an expedition into the park, there are other options. Local air taxis provide flight-seeing trips, day trips or overnight camp outs at remote locations. Imagine a day spent fishing at an alpine lake, or watching the caribou up in the northern valleys, or sitting alongside a wild river listening to the wind in the boreal forest. Air taxis will also take visitors into neighboring Kobuk Valley National Park to get their passport stamp.
Whatever trip option you choose, be prepared for the experience of a lifetime.

Traveling in a remote wilderness park requires visitors to be self sufficient and flexible.

You need to arrive at your jumping off point with everything you need for a safe and comfortable trip.
Bush travel requires flexibility.  There are many reasons for delays going in and out of the park.  You should take enough food to remain in the park several extra days.  It is also a good idea to have a back up route plan with maps just in case.
Before you leave for your trip, contact the Park and Preserve for updates and advisories.
Visitors in the park must practice minimum impact techniques, adhere to Leave No Trace principles, follow backcountry safety guidelines, and be aware of the fragile ecosystems and private lands within the park.
Before you go into the backcountry, stop by the Bettles Ranger Station, Coldfoot Arctic Interagency Visitor Center, Marion Creek Ranger Station (near Coldfoot), or Anaktuvuk Pass Ranger Station for a backcountry orientation.
 We request that you fill out the voluntary Back Country Registration Form.
You will also have the opportunity to check out Bear Resistant Food Containers (BRFCs) at these locations. BRFCs are the easiest way to meet the mandatory food storage regulations for all overnight visitors in the Park.

Also visit our Backpacking & Hiking and Wild & Scenic Rivers pages to plan your trip.

Visit the Basic Information page for operating hours and seasons, permits and reservations, and bringing pets to the park.

Lots of information for your visit, all packed into easily downloadable and printable PDF files! Please feel free to phone (907-692-5494) or email us if you have any questions that are not answered by this material.
List of Outfitters, Guides, and Air Taxi Operators

Lake Clark
==========

Leashed pets are permitted in the park and preserve. However, we strongly encourage you to leave your pets at home, for your safety, their safety, and the health of the ecosystem. If your dog is already in Alaska with you, a quick Google search will give you a list of kennels that can board it for you during your trip to Lake Clark. Common park gateway communities with pet boarding facilities include Anchorage, Soldotna, Kenai, Kasilof, Homer, and Anchor Point.
Dogs running loose can bring enraged bears or moose back to their owners. They can also harass or kill local wildlife. While it's pretty obvious when a dog is chasing a moose or a squirrel, a loose dog can eat ground nesting bird eggs and chicks so quickly the owner never realizes it happened. They may also either contract a disease from wild canine populations, or introduce disease to fox, coyote, or wolf through their scat. Be aware that these wild canines are highly territorial, especially during summer denning season, and will kill loose dogs they encounter in their territory.
If you must bring your pet, remember that it must be leashed at ALL times, and that you must properly dispose of its scat by either burying it in a 6 inch cathole like you would your own waste, or by packing it out.

Lassen Volcanic
==========

Where may I go with my pet?
A good rule of thumb is that a pet may go anywhere a car may go: roads and road shoulders (not snow-covered), campgrounds, picnic areas, and parking lots.
Where are pets not allowed?
Pets are not permitted on any hiking trail, in the park backcountry (including snow-covered roads or trails), in any body of water, or inside visitor centers or other park facilities.
Are there regulations regarding pets in the park*?

Pets must be on a leash less than six feet long at all times.
Pets under physical restraint are permitted overnight in developed campgrounds.
Pets can be left unattended in vehicles. However, if hazardous conditions exist, such as hot weather, owners can be cited for endangering an animal.
Pets can not be left unattended AND tied to an object, except in designated areas or under conditions which may be established by the superintendent.
Please clean up after your pet and take responsibility for its behavior.

*The regulations do not apply to Seeing Eye dogs accompanying visually impaired persons or other guide animals for disabled individuals.
Why are activities with pets in the park limited?
As a national park, Lassen afford special protection to wildlife and habitat. Pets can create conditions that may disturb these protected resources.

The territorial scent dogs leave behind disrupts the behavior of native animals that this park has been set aside to protect.
Dogs are predators that could chase, scare, kill, and transmit diseases to wild animals.
Wild animals can transmit diseases including bubonic plague to pets (and then to humans).
Bears and other predators are curious about dogs and have been known to attack them in wilderness areas.
Volcanic soils and hydrothermal areas can severely wound a dog's feet; terrain that may be appealing to hikers may be difficult or even deadly for pets.

Are there areas outside of the park where I may take my pet?
Lassen Volcanic National Park is surrounded by Lassen National Forest, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands, and numerous wilderness areas. These areas allow pets with limited regulations.
Spattercone Nature Trail | Old Station/Hat Creek
Heart Lake Trail | Shingletown
Caribous Wilderness Area
Ishi Wilderness Area | Paynes Cree
Sacramento River Bend Area | Red Bluf
Lake Almanor Recreation Trail | Chester
Bizz Johnson Trail Westwood/Susanville

Mammoth Cave
==========

Pets must be on a leash at all times at Mammoth Cave National Park. No pets are permitted in any cave with the exception of designated service animals. Pets are not permitted in guest rooms at The Lodge of Mammoth Cave, Sunset Terrace, or the Hotel Cottages; pets are permitted in the Woodland Cottages. Designated service animals are permitted in guest rooms. The hotel maintains a kennel; call (844)760-2283 or email for availability.

Mesa Verde
==========

Activities with pets are very limited at Mesa Verde National Park. Pets are not allowed on trails, in archeological sites, or in buildings (service animals, excepted). Pets may be walked along paved roads, in parking lots, and at the campground. Pets must be leashed at all times when outside a vehicle. Leaving pets unattended or tied to any object within the park is prohibited, including the exterior of motor vehicles parked within park boundaries.
Leashed pets are allowed on some of the trails on Wetherill Mesa when it is open in the spring, summer, and fall. Pet-friendly trails are marked and include the 5-mile Long House Loop. Please check signs at trailsheads before taking your pet on any trail. A number of pet-waste stations are available along the Wetherill trails, so please clean up after your pet.

Be Aware!
Please remember that your pet is as susceptible to the heat as you are. Keep your pet hydrated and cool. Pets may be left unattended within motor vehicles with proper ventilation and water, only in weather that is not hazardous to the immediate welfare of the animal. With daytime temperatures at Mesa Verde ranging from 80° to over 90° from late-spring to early-fall, the inside of a car can get hot very quickly, endangering your pet. On warm days, the temperature in a car can rise to 120° in a matter of minutes, even with the windows opened slightly. There are few shady locations to park your car, so even on cooler days, temperatures within the car can still rise to dangerous levels.

Service Animals
There are many opportunities and locations within Mesa Verde National Park for individuals with service animals to visit and enjoy. Because these opportunities change on a seasonal basis, please contact us so we may assist you with both pre-planning and during your visit.

Mount Rainier
==========

Pets are welcome at Mount Rainier in certain areas, but they and their owners must practice the following:

At all times, pets must be on a leash not more than six feet in length or in a cage.
At all times, pets must be with and under the control of their owners.
Owners must pick up and dispose of all fecal matter.

At Mount Rainier, pets are NOT allowed in the following areas (service animals excepted):

On trails**
In wilderness and/or off-trail areas
Inside buildings
In amphitheaters
On roads closed for winter

**The Pacific Crest Trail is the one exception to this rule. Dogs on a leash no longer than 6 feet are permitted on the Pacific Crest Trail.

Pets are permitted at Mount Rainier in the following areas:

In parking lots
In campgrounds
On paved roads open to public vehicles, and no more than 25 feet from paved roads

While in these areas, pets must, at all times, be leashed or crated and with their owners.
For the safety of your pet and the benefit of park wildlife and other visitors, never leave your pet unattended in a vehicle or in the campground.

Mount Rainier National Park does not have kennel facilities.

There are also a lot of dog friendly options in the surrounding areas outside of the park.

North Cascades
==========

A hiker and her dog enjoy a vista on a trail in the Ross Lake Recreation Area--please be responsible and leash your pet Lin Skavdahl

Brought Your Dog Along? Know Where Your Pet Can Go
Dogs and other pets are not allowed within the national park except on a leash on the Pacific Crest Trail, and within 50 feet of roads. Service animals are allowed for those with disabilities.
Pets are allowed on a leash within the Ross Lake and Lake Chelan National Recreation Areas. Pets are also allowed on most surrounding national forest lands.
If you are not sure where you can hike with your pet, please call the Wilderness Information Center at 360-854-7245 for trip suggestions.
Here's Why

Dogs intimidate other hikers, depriving them of the peace wilderness provides.
Dogs disrupt native wildlife patterns and can harass, injure or kill wildlife—especially when off leash.
Where pets are allowed, leashes protect dogs from becoming lost and from wilderness hazards such as porcupines, mountain lions, bears, and sick, injured, or rabid animals.
Where pets are allowed, leashes also protect the experience of other visitors who may be afraid, allergic, or who do not want a dog approaching them.
National parks are special. They are one of the last remaining places in the world set aside for the protection of wildlife. Enjoy hiking with your dog elsewhere, and leave these places wild.

Be a Responsible Pet Owner

Keep pets on a leash--it's respectful to others and it is the law.
Pick up after your pet.
Don't leave pets alone in a car while hiking. Choose another hike or come back another day.

Olympic
==========

Following the rules of BARK! NPS photo

Guidelines for dog owners visiting Olympic National Park. Please follow the rules of BARK!

Pinnacles
==========

Many people consider their pets to be part of the family and want to bring them along on their visit to Pinnacles. Unfortunately, pets in the wilderness can cause big problems, both for the wildlife and the pets! Pets disturb, harass, and sometimes even kill wildlife. They leave a scent that may disrupt, or alter the behavior of the native wild animals Pinnacles protects. Pets may also attract predators or transmit diseases to fragile habitat while in the park.

Where can pets go?
Pets are allowed in the picnic areas, campground, parking lots, and on paved roads. Remember, your pet must be physically controlled on a six foot leash. Don’t forget to clean up after your pet, no matter where you are. Pet waste can be disposed of in any park dumpster.

Where can’t pets go?
Pets are prohibited on all park trails. Pets are not allowed on the shuttle or in any buildings such as visitor centers or the Bear Gulch Nature Center.

Pets should not be left unattended in a vehicle when conditions are unsafe. Please keep in mind that temperatures at Pinnacles National Park can vary widely. Temperatures in the 90s and 100s are common in the summer months. Cool, cloudy mornings can turn into surprisingly warm days, even in winter. If it is hotter than 70 degrees outside, it is too hot for pets inside of vehicles. Pets may not be left unattended when tied to anything such as a tree or picnic table.

Leashed pets may be walked along park roads, in picnic areas, and in the campground. Photo by Beth Hudick

Redwood

Pets. Please follow the rules of BARK!

Rangers' Tip: If you want to walk through old-growth redwoods with your leashed pet - then try CAL BARREL ROAD (Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park), or WALKER ROAD (Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park).

This leashed BARK! Ranger enjoyed a walk under redwood trees along Cal Barrel Road. Photo: Redwood Parks Conservancy

Pets are wonderful creatures that give more than comfort and companionship. We love our fur-babies and want to keep them (and you) safe while at the Redwoods!

There are carnivores like bears, coyotes and mountain lions, as well as herds of very protective Roosevelt elk in our parks. You, or your pet can quickly get into harms way if your pet encounters park wildlife. The scent of your dog, or even a single bark can cause wild animals to be agitated.

Pets are not allowed on any park trails or at ranger-led programs.

Service Animals

Service animals are allowed in all facilities and on all trails unless an area has been closed by the superintendent to protect park rescources.

The 2010 revision to Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), defines a "service animal" as a dog that has been individually trained to do work, or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.

Dogs that are not trained to perform tasks that mitigate the effects of a disability, including dogs that are used purely to provide comfort or emotional support ("therapy animals"), are considered pets. Falsely portraying a pet as a service animal is considered fraud and is subject to federal prosecution.

Ranger pledge, and stamp their certificate. BARK! Rangers can purchase an exclusive Redwood BARK! Ranger dog collar tag from our Redwood Parks Conservancy bookstores!

What's the Harm With Pets in Wild Places?

Predators including bears, mountain lions, and coyotes may see pets as prey, placing both pet and owner in danger.
Some pets may mark territory with scent or spread domestic disease, interfering with natural patterns and causing injury to wildlife.
Even normally well-behaved pets can become stressed by unfamiliar surroundings, threatening visitors and wildlife in close situations such as on park trails.
Dead salmon, found along riverbanks throughout the parks, can be extremely toxic to dogs.

Where Are Close-by Alternatives?

Pets under your control are allowed at the following nearby locations (be sure to inquire locally for specific regulations), from north to south:

Smith River National Recreation Area-all campgrounds and trails (pets must be leashed): east of Crescent City, Calif. via U.S. 199.
Public beaches in Crescent City, Calif.
Moonstone Beach: Westhaven Drive exit off U.S. 101, just south of Trinidad, Calif.
Clam Beach County Park: Clam Beach exit off U.S. 101, near McKinleyville, Calif.
Arcata Community Forest in Arcata, Calif.

Rocky Mountain
==========

The Endovalley Road is a nice place to walk your dog. NPS/Biddle

Pets are prohibited on ALL Rocky Mountain National Park trails, tundra, and meadows.
Pets and owners have a special bond. But a national park is not always the best place for pets. Rocky Mountain National Park is a designated natural area, and its purpose is to preserve and protect the park's natural conditions, scenic beauty, and wildlife.
Where Pets Can Go
Leashed pets may accompany you only in the following areas:

Along established roads or in parking areas
In established campgrounds and picnic areas

Pets must be kept on leashes no longer than six feet. Pets may not make noise that impacts visitors or wildlife. Pet owners must pick up and dispose of pet excrement in trash receptacles.
Why Can't I Have My Dog on Trails?

Rocky is a wilderness. Your pet could become prey for wildlife like coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, and Great Horned Owls.
Dogs are predators that can chase, scare, and transmit diseases. Dogs leave behind a ‘predator’ scent. This scent can linger, disrupting the native animals this park protects.
Dogs can bite humans, and some people are uncomfortable around dogs. Park visitors should be able to enjoy native wildlife in their natural environment without disruption from other visitors’ pets.
Pets may dig or trample fragile vegetation.

When Your Pet is Here, You Must Follow Park Rules
You may not leave your pet unattended in vehicles if it creates a danger to the animal or if the animal becomes a public nuisance. Pets may not be left tied to vehicles, trees, or other objects.
Pets, more than humans, are susceptible to overheating. Even in the mountains on mile days, temperatures inside vehicles rise quickly, and pets left in vehicles can overheat and die. Cracked windows provide little relief.
Pets are not allowed in any park visitor centers.
Doggy daycare, boarding facilities, and veterinary clinics are available in nearby communities.
Service Animals and Emotional Support Animals
Service animals that have been individually trained to perform specific tasks for the benefit of persons with disabilities are allowed in the park.
Emotional support/therapy animals are not service animals under the Americans with Disabilities Act and may not access visitor centers, trails, or other non-motorized areas.
Pet owners violating park regulations may be cited, fined, and/or issued a mandatory appearance before the United States Magistrate Court in Denver.

Hiking Alternatives Outside Rocky Mountain National Park
If you'd like to hike with your pets, there are nearby trails outside Rocky Mountain National Park, including trails in Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forest, multi-use trails around the Town of Estes Park, and Larimer County Open Space areas. Always check for local conditions.

Outdoors with Pets
For the protection of your animal, visitors, and Saguaro National Park, pets are allowed only on roadways, picnic areas (except Mam-A-Gah picnic area in the Tucson Mountain District-west) and paved trails (Desert Ecology Trail & Desert Discovery Trail). Pets must be kept on a leash that does not exceed 6 feet at all times. Pets may not be taken on trails, off road, or inside both visitor centers. Pets may not be left unattended in or outside of a vehicle at any time.
Safety for your pet:
Many threats exist within the park: cactus spines, thorny brush, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and open mine shafts. Heat stroke has lead to death of otherwise healthy animals in the desert. Dogs in unfamiliar surroundings may not drink water even if offered.
Safety and consideration of other trail users:
In areas where dogs are allowed on the trail, hikers have been threatened and bitten even by friendly dogs and those on a leash. Some people hike in national parks to avoid dogs.
­

Impacts on wildlife:
Native animals can be displaced and disturbed by the scent of dogs (felt to be predators). Coyotes and foxes can catch common pet diseases such as parvo; wildlife diseases can pass in the other direction.

Good Dog Walks In Saguaro National Park
At Saguaro East
The Mica View Road is a route that you can start at the picnic area or scenic loop drive turn-off. This provides a trail-like one mile and a half round trip through a lush cactus landscape for you and your pet.
The Desert Ecology trail is a paved, 1/4 mile trail which is also dog friendly.
The paved Cactus Forest Loop is also dog-friendly, try the stretch from North Cactus Forest trailhead to Loma Verde trailhead. This route is less strenuous and has good sight distances for the safety of you and cyclist / motorists.
At Saguaro West
The unpaved Bajada Loop Drive is dog-friendly as is the half-mile, paved, Desert Discovery trail.
Since the paved roads in the west district are heavily used by commuters, it is not recommended to walk those routes.

Service Animals
Service Animals are exempt from these rules, and my go anywhere their owners are permitted to go.

Sequoia
==========

Pets and Wildlife

For you and your neighbors to see and appreciate wildlife, please note that pets are not permitted on any trails at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
In campgrounds and picnic areas, pets must be kept on a leash at all times. The leash must be less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. For your pet's safety, please don't leave pets in hot cars. Pets cannot be left tied and unattended at any time.
Nearby Areas where Pets are Permitted
In the national forest lands that surround these parks, leashed pets are allowed on trails. Leashes must be less than 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. See the map below for locations of national forest areas adjoining Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Giant Sequoia National Monument is administered by the U.S. Forest Service.
Service Animals
Service animals are allowed in national parks, including facilities, trails, and campgrounds.

Leashed pets are allowed on the national forest lands surrounding the parks.

Shenandoah
==========

Shenandoah National Park is one of the few national parks that allow pets on trails. The regulations covering pets and their owners are developed to allow you to share your park experience with your pet while protecting the native animals and other park resources, as well as other visitors. If you choose to bring your pet to Shenandoah you must be prepared to follow the regulations.

Your pet must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet at all times.

Pets are allowed in campgrounds and pet-friendly lodging is available.

Pets are allowed, if leashed, on most trails.

Pets are NOT allowed on Ranger Programs

Pets are NOT allowed on the following trails

Fox Hollow Trail (mile 4.6)

Stony Man Trail (mile 41.7) except for portion that follows the Appalachian Trail

Limberlost Trail (mile 43)

Post Office Junction to Old Rag Shelter

Old Rag Ridge Trail

Old Rag Saddle Trail

Dark Hollow Falls Trail (mile 50.7)

Story of the Forest Trail (mile 51)

Bearfence Mountain Trail (mile 56.4)

Frazier Discovery Trail (mile 79.5)

This list totals fewer than 20 miles of the 500 miles of trails in the Shenandoah National Park.

Remember that you are taking your pet into a different environment and you are responsible for your pet. Do you have enough water for yourself and your pet? Does your pet have the endurance (and paw pads!) to hike the trail you have chosen? What will your pet do if you encounter a bear or a snake? Have you considered your pet in your preparations? Nearly every summer weekend we have numerous carry-outs when hikers are injured or become ill. It takes all our staff to keep our visitors and the park safe. If your pet becomes disabled on the trail, what will you do? With a little preparation, you and your pet can have an enjoyable trip in Shenandoah National Park.

Theodore Roosevelt
==========

Pets are welcome in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. If you are planning to visit with your pet, you will need to make a few special considerations.
Pet Safety
The park is home to all kinds of animals, big and small. Because the park is their home and we and our pets are the visitors, regulations are in place to minimize our impacts on wildlife.

When in the park, pets should always be leashed when not otherwise contained in a vehicle or tent. To maintain proper control, leashes should be 6 feet or shorter. Be aware that dogs can agitate bison, horses, and other animals, creating unsafe situations. Maintain extra distance from wildlife when enjoying the park with your dog. Never leave pets unattended.
Where can I walk my Dog?
Leashed pets may be walked along roads and road shoulders, sidewalks, parking areas, and in campgrounds and picnic areas. The sidewalk at the Painted Canyon Visitor Center (I-94, exit 32) is a good place to walk dogs and has fantastic views of the badlands all along the way. Be sure to clean up after your pet.

Helpful hint: On hot days, the best places to walk pets are campgrounds and picnic areas where there is shade. Other areas of the park are fully exposed to the sun.
Hiking with Your Dog (outside the park)
While dogs are not permitted on trails within the park, there are nearby trails where you can take your dogs for some exercise.

In Medora, a paved path leads from the park's entrance, west along the little Missouri River to the Maah Daah Hey Trail. The paved path is about 1 mile long (one-way).

The Maah Daah Hey Trail (MDHT) is a 150 mile long path open to horseback riders, hikers, mountain bikers, and PETS! (Pets and bikes are not permitted on sections of the MDHT that lie within the national park.) You and your dog can hike south on the MDHT where the bike path ends, west of Medora, or pick up the trail from one of many other trailheads.

Near the park's North Unit, the USFS CCC Campground has access to the MDHT and the Long X Trail, both open to pets.
Horseback Riding
What better way to see the badlands than from the back of a horse, as Roosevelt did?
Horseback riding is permitted on all backcountry trails as well as cross country (off-trail travel). For safety reasons, horses are not permitted on nature trails (trails under 1 mile), or in general-use campgrounds and picnic areas. Roundup Group Horse Camp is available by reservation. Horse users can camp in the backcountry, which requires a free permit.

Horseback riders must abide by regulations regarding horse use. Certified weed-free forage is required in the park.

The park no longer offers guided trail rides.

Pet Owner Responsibility

Pets must be on a 6-foot leash, under control and attended to at all times.
All pet excrement must be collected and disposed of properly in a trash receptacle.
All pets must be vaccinated and possess a valid vaccination tag as required by Koochiching and St. Louis County.

Health Watch: Blastomycosis
Blastomycosis occurs throughout the Great Lake states, including Minnesota. Within the state of Minnesota, there are some hotspots, including the northern counties and also several counties in the Metro area. There is no evidence that blastomycosis is any more prevalent within Voyageurs National Park than in other parts of the state where the disease is prevalent.

There are many health risks to humans and pets when going anywhere outdoors, including parasites and diseases spread by insects, ticks, fungi, etc. It is the responsibility of the individual to know the risks and take measures to prevent them.

For more information on Blastomycosis, please visit the Minnesota Department of Health.

Special Use Permits for Dog Sled Teams
Dog teams and dog sleds are permitted on frozen lake surfaces within the park when adequate ice and snow conditions are present. However, a written Special Use Permit is required for dog teams and dog sleds traveling on designated snowmobile portages.

Wind Cave
==========

Pets are welcome at Wind Cave National Park within the following limits.
At all times pets must be restrained on a leash no longer than six feet in length. Leashes protect dogs from becoming lost and from potential encounters with wildlife as well as protecting park wildlife and plants.

Pets should not be left unattended. Summer sunshine poses a threat to pets left in vehicles. On a sunny day, even in temperatures as low as 60° F, temperatures inside a vehicle can reach dangerous levels. On an 85-degree day the temperature inside a car –even with the windows cracked –can reach over 100 degrees within 10 minutes.
Pet owners are responsible for removing pet waste from campgrounds, picnic areas, parking lots, roads, and other developed areas.
Pets are not permitted in the back-country areas of the park. This includes areas near park roadways and most of the trails –see below for exceptions.

Where CAN I go with my pet?

Wrangell–St. Elias
==========

Dogs are allowed in the backcountry and they must be properly controlled at all times. Please note that dogs must be on a leash while in the Kennecott Historic Landmark area and on the immediate grounds around the contact stations, including the Headquarters Visitor Center at Copper Center and the Boreal Forest Trail, the Chitina Ranger Station and the Slana Ranger Station. Only certified service dogs may accompany a visitor inside the contact stations (visitor centers and ranger stations).

Pet Owners: Know that trapping is popular and legal in Alaska from Fall through Spring (seasons vary by location and species). Unleashed pets can get caught in traps or snares. Maintaining physical control of your pet is advised since it is your responsibility to prevent harm to your pet.

Trappers: Be mindful of other trail users when making sets. Avoid setting traps or snares along popular recreational trails. Follow the trapper's 'Code of Ethics' found in the Alaska Trapping Regulations book.

Learn more about pet safety regarding traps and snares at the Alaska Dept of Fish and Game website or download the brochure on how to remove pets from traps or snares.

Yellowstone
==========

Activities with pets are limited in Yellowstone: they are not allowed on trails or boardwalks, in the backcountry, or in thermal areas. NPS/Neal Herbert

Bringing a pet to Yellowstone may limit your activities in the park. Protect your pet and park wildlife by observing these regulations:

Pets may only accompany people in developed areas and must remain within 100 feet (30.5 meters) of roads, parking areas, and campgrounds.
Pets must be physically controlled at all times: they must be in a car, in a crate, or on a leash no more than six feet long.
Pets are not allowed on boardwalks, hiking trails, in the backcountry, or in thermal areas.
Pets may not be left unattended or tied to an object.
Pets may not be left in a situation where food, water, shade, ventilation, and other basic needs are inadequate. Pets may remain in vehicles for short periods of time, but we recommend that someone stay behind to personally ensure their well being.
Owners must bag and dispose of pet waste.

There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the regulations for carried pets (in arms, carriers, strollers, backpacks, and so forth) in restricted parts of the park.
These policies exist to protect pets from being killed by predators like bears and coyotes, to protect them from being burned or killed in hot springs, to prevent the exchange of diseases between domestic animals and park wildlife, and to allow others to enjoy the park without the disruption of pets.
Boarding
There are no kennels in Yellowstone but this service is available in surrounding communities.
Service Animals
Qualified service animals assisting people with disabilities are allowed throughout the park and in all park facilities. However, they must be leashed.

Park Ranger George Heinz covers some of the rules and provides advice related to traveling with pets in Yellowstone.

Zion
==========

Pa'rus Trail

To protect wildlife, the experience of other visitors, and your pet, the following rules apply at Zion National Park:

Leashed pets may be walked on the Pa'rus Trail. All other trails, and all wilderness areas, are closed to pets.

Pets are not allowed on shuttle buses or in public buildings within Zion.

Pet waste must be immediately removed and disposed of in trash receptacles.

Pets must be under physical control on a leash less than six feet long at all times. Properly restrained pets are allowed along public roads and parking areas, in the developed campgrounds and picnic areas, and on the grounds of the Zion Lodge.

Zion is hot! The interior temperature of a vehicle can quickly warm to dangerous levels, during most months of the year. Leaving a pet unattended in a vehicle with environmental conditions that pose a health risk to the animal is prohibited.

No pets, other than service animals (as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act) are allowed on the shuttle buses. Learn more about Service Animals

Properly-restrained pets may be left unattended in developed campgrounds only when environmental conditions are safe for the animal, and the animal is not making unreasonable noise (barking, etc.)

36 CFR 2.15 (Code of Federal Regulations) provides more details concerning pets within National Park Service areas. Pet owners not adhering to regulations may be cited (minimum fine is $100).
